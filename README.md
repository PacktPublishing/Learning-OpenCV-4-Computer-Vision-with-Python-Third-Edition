**Get to grips with tools, techniques, and algorithms for computer vision and machine learning**

## What is this book about?
Computer vision is a rapidly evolving science, encompassing diverse applications and techniques. This book will not only help those who are getting started with computer vision but also experts in the domain. You’ll be able to put theory into practice by building apps with OpenCV 4 and Python 3.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Install and familiarize yourself with OpenCV 4's Python 3 bindings 
* Understand image processing and video analysis basics 
* Use a depth camera to distinguish foreground and background regions 
* Detect and identify objects, and track their motion in videos 
* Train and use your own models to match images and classify objects 
* Detect and recognize faces, and classify their gender and age 
* Build an augmented reality application to track an image in 3D 
* Work with machine learning models, including SVMs, artificial neural networks(ANNs), and deep neural networks(DNNs)

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import cv2

grayImage = cv2.imread('MyPic.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
cv2.imwrite('MyPicGray.png', grayImage)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are interested in learning computer vision, machine learning, and OpenCV in the context of practical real-world applications, then this book is for you. This OpenCV book will also be useful for anyone getting started with computer vision as well as experts who want to stay up-to-date with OpenCV 4 and Python 3. Although no prior knowledge of image processing, computer vision or machine learning is required, familiarity with basic Python programming is a must.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
